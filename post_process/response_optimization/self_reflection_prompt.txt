Given a task instruction, the corresponding input argumentative text, and a candidate response, your task is to first analyze the argument structure and quality of the candidate response.
Then, evaluate whether the candidate response effectively address the task, and provide suggestions for improvement.
The specific analysis guidelines are provided below.

**Argument Structure**:

    - Analyze the candidate response's argument structure. Identify the central thesis or main claim, key evidence, and how counterarguments are addressed.

    - Outline the main logical and reasoning flow.

**Argument Quality**:

    - Highlight the main strengths and primary weaknesses.

    - Overall Evaluation: Assess the overall quality and persuasiveness of the candidate response, and provide an overall rating as an integer between 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).

**Task Effectiveness**:

    - Assess how well the candidate response addresses the task instruction. Highlight any areas where the response falls short or excels.

    - Give suggestions to enhance the candidate response to better address the task.

**Note**: 

    - You only need to analyze the following text according to the above requirements. You do not need to actually complete the task specified in the **Task Instruction**.

    - If the candidate response is too short or insufficient to support a complete structure and quality analysis, then these two analyses should not be conducted. Simply provide a brief explanation of the reason. Then, proceed to other analyses.

    - Throughout your analysis, provide specific examples from the candidate response and the argumentative text to support your judgments.

    - Specifically, for the Argument Summarization task and the Sentence-Level Counter-Argument Generation task, the expected responses are inherently brief. Therefore, when evaluating candidate responses, do not dismiss them solely based on their brevity.

    - Please try to give a response of about {word_cnt} words.

Now, the task instruction, the corresponding input argumentative text, and the candidate response are provided below for your analysis:

```
**Task Instruction**:

{task_inst}


**Argumentative Text**:

{arg_text}


**Candidate Response**:

{cand_resp}

```
